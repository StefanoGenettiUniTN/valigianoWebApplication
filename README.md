# Valligiano
Valligiano is a running championship which is organized once a year in Val di Non, which is a beautiful place in the north of Italy. For more information about the championship and the involved teams visit the [official website](https://valligianovaldinon.wordpress.com/).

# Software support
The championship is attended by several teams which compete with their athletes. Every race the athletes and the corresponding teams gain points according to the position in the ranking. In the past the secretary used to handle the insertment, modification, deletion and elaboration of the data using a really complicated and prone to error Excel spreadsheet. The purpose of this project is to develop a web application to handle the *information system* in a easier, safier and more proper way.<br>
The main technologies involved are:
- HTML, CSS, Javascript, W3.CSS, Ajax, JQuery
- PHP
- MariaDB, SQL
<br>
Folder webAppValigianoVersione2022 contains the last version of the project which is periodically updated according to the requirements of the administrative staff.

The main purpose of this repository is not to provide a useful documentation of the software solution (which is noted on physical papers), but to backup the various versions of the project which is updated once every one or two years. Following this method, we can easily recover the various implementations of the software from the commits.
